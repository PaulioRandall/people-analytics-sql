# SQL and the People Analytics dataset

## Purpose

This project showcases my data engineering and SQL skills. I hope to show off some data analytics with SQL here too.

It should be noted that this dataset doesn't really need any engineering before analysis. It's small and clean enough to start visualisation. In fact, noramlisation will make actual analysis with SQL harder, not easier.

However, that wouldn't allow me to show off my knowledge and skills would it. You grow and shine by doing hard things. If I were optimising for productivity or business value then I'd consider skipping the database stuff and throw the dataset into a spreadsheet tool like Google sheets.
